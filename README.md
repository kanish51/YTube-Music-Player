## Working
It uses Youtube API to get data. The video id is then passed to youtube-dl (hosted on my server) which returns the streaming url.
## How to use
1. Just open the project in android studio.
2. Open TrendingFrag.java file and replace YOUR_API_KEY with your youtube api key in line 60 and 62.
3. Build apk.
